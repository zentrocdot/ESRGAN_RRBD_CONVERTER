## Preface

<p align="justify">I am writing this README section to clarify some
things for myself. Since I am absolutely new to the field of creating
and using AI models, there are some basic things to clarify.</p>

## Conversions

<p align="justify">I am currently considering two scenarios for the
converters.</p>

<p align="justify">The directions of the conversions are shown by
the arrows.</p>

+ Scenario I

```
old ESRGAN → new ESRGAN ← RealESRGAn
```

+ Scenario II

```
new ESRGAN → RealESrgan
```
