# Preface

<p align="justify">Resources for converting of models from old ESRGAN
to new ESRGAN architecture. Resources for converting RealESRGAN models
to new ESRGAN models. There is also a new converter for converting 
new ESRGAN models to RealESRGAN models. Bonus material are the standalone
upscalers for ESRGAN and RealESRGAN (The latter two are rudimentarily
documented). Last standalone converter versions can be found in folder
<code>converter</code>.</p>
