## Preface

<p align="justify">A small idea has now turned into a small project.
To make myself independent of the web user interfaces for the AI image
generation, which are offering a high sophisticated upscaling capability,
I implement different approaches for the upscaling of images for myself.</p>

<p align="justify">I worked in parallel with ESRGAN and RealESRGAN.
Both approaches delivered quite impressive results from a standing start. 
However, the number of functioning models is limited for the time being. 
This is where the converters come into play, with which the number of
models can potentially be increased. 
</p>

<p align="justify">At short notice and on a whim, I took a closer and
more intensive look at the topic. The interim result of my deliberations
can be found here in the repository. However, only some of the things
I tried out and did can be found here.</p>

<p align="justify">The quality of the results achieved in the meantime
speaks for itself and justifies the use of ESRGAN and RealESRGAN.</p>

## Motivation

<p align="justify">While I was working on implementing an upscaling
method for images using ESRGAN models, the question arose as to how
I can use all available ESRGAN models with the approach I am working
with.</p>

<p align="justify">If one uses ESRGAN models from external sources 
and not the original proposed ESRGAN models, one will get sometimes 
errors which results in a failure of the upscaling process.</p>

<p align="justify">A simple converter could be found in the original 
ESRGAN sources I intended to use. That this is a converter was not
obvious.I have adapted this converter for my personal purposes.</p>

<p align="justify">Now some upscalers that I am already using with
the web user interface <i>AUTOMATIC1111</i> I can also use in my
own upscaler application or standalone. I can now also use upscalers
from different other sources.</p>

## Introduction

<p align="justify">I implemneted ERSGAN [1] and RealESRGAN [2] in
my <i>Lazy Image Upscaler</i>. To be able to test more than the given
four models from xinntao I searched and collected other ERSGAN models
and tried them out, most of the time without success. One model in use
by the web user interface <i>AUTOMATIC1111</i> [5] was also working. The
usage of other models from other sources failed for the time being.</p>

<p align="justify">I will use the ERSGAN method (and the RealERSGAN) in
his given form from xinntao independend from other software tools. The 
only thing I need is a converter to prepare more or less the most ESRGAN
models for use with xinntaos approach.</p>

> [!NOTE]  
> I am interested in the generative AI image creation. Of course, I am
> also interested in theory when necessary, but only when it is helpful.
> Keeping this in mind my interest is focussed on how to use a model and
> not how to train a model.

## Technical Background

### Brief Introduction

<p align="justify">The ESRGAN (Enhanced Super-Resolution Generative
Adversarial Networks) is improving the model architecture using the
RRDB (Residual-in-residual Dense Block) without batch normalization
based on the observations of EDSR. ESRGAN uses RaGAN (Relativistic
GAN) relative loss instead of the perceptual loss and adversarial
loss. It also improves the perceptual loss with VGG loss used in
SRGAN. ESRGAN and RealESRGAn are direct improvments of SRGAN. The
influence of EDSR should also be noted. A good article to the topic
is [8].</p>

Abbreviations explained can be found [here](https://civitai.com/articles/7432/ai-abbreviations-uncovered).

<p align="justify">Within this repository I am focussing on ESRGAN
and RealESRGAN. When we are talking about the implmentation of what 
the last sections explains, we have to discuss the internal structure 
of given ESRGAN model.</p>

<p align="justify">The old (outdated) models have a differnet internal
structure to the new (current) models with respect to the used keys.
The value to the key is still a tensor.</p>

<p align="justify">For the conversion one needs a translation table
or conversion table for the keys which looks like:</p>

```
    "model.0.weight"                     ->  "conv_first.weight"
    "model.0.bias"                       ->  "conv_first.bias":
    "model.1.sub.0.RDB1.conv1.0.weight"  ->  "RRDB_trunk.0.RDB1.conv1.weight" 
    "model.1.sub.0.RDB1.conv1.0.bias"    ->  "RRDB_trunk.0.RDB1.conv1.bias"
    "model.1.sub.23.weight"              ->  "trunk_conv.weight"
    "model.1.sub.23.bias"                ->  "trunk_conv.bias" 
    "model.3.weight"                     ->  "upconv1.weight" 
    "model.3.bias"                       ->  "upconv1.bias" 
    "model.6.weight"                     ->  "upconv2.weight" 
    "model.6.bias"                       ->  "upconv2.bias" 
    "model.8.weight"                     ->  "HRconv.weight" 
    "model.8.bias"                       ->  "HRconv.bias" 
    "model.10.weight"                    ->  "conv_last.weight"
    "model.10.bias"                      ->  "conv_last.bias"
```

<p align="justify">The value to the key is a tensor. One has
to consider while converting that given tensor shape is the
tensor shape which is required by the final model.</p>

## Name of the Repository

<p align="justify">ESRGAN is used together with RRDB. This is
the base concept. I provide tools for the conversion between
ESRGAN models and converter for this methodology. So after
some back and forth the name was born. At the latest when
I understood the connections better.</p>

## What is Implemented So Far

<p align="justify">I have converted the original supplied converter
for old RSGAN to the new RSGAN for my personal purposes. Then I 
modernized the implementation a little bit. Next I figured out, that
some models look like ESRGAN modesl, but that they are not the models 
I can use or that they are no ESRGAN or somes¬¥thing is strange with
the models. To have an idea what a model does I wrote a simple 
analysing tools. This tool identifies highly reliable old an new
ERSGAN models and it is able to find out if a model is possibly
RealsESRGAN. This is important driven by the fact that sometime 
a model is wrong declared. Next I wrot a converter from RealESRGAN
to ESRGAN. This converter works so far quite good.</p>

## How to Use the Main Converter

<p align="justify">You need following two files from the <code>scripts</code>
folder to get the converter run.</p>

```
RRDBNet_arch.py
```

```
converter_RRDB_models.py
```

<p align="justify"><code>converter_RRDB_models.py</code> is the
converter script and <code>RRDBNet_arch.py</code> is the Python 
module which contains the classes which are required to run the
converter script. The latter file is imported from the converter.
</p>

<p align="justify">Run the converter as follows:</p>

```
python3 converter_RRDB_models.py <upscaler_model_file_name.pth>
```

## Error Handling

<p align="justify">Errors are catched and the <i>Traceback</i>
is printed out into the terminal window. This looks like:</p>

```
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/home/hades/ssd-sandisk/AI_Tools/ESRGAN/ESRGAN/models/experimentell_converter_RRDB_models.py", line 97, in main
    crt_net[key] = pretrained_net[value]
KeyError: 'model.8.weight'

Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/home/hades/ssd-sandisk/AI_Tools/ESRGAN/ESRGAN/models/experimentell_converter_RRDB_models.py", line 97, in main
    crt_net[key] = pretrained_net[value]
KeyError: 'model.8.bias'

```

<p align="justify">This is no longer an error. This behaviour
is considered in the last version of the converter. But other
errors need to be catched.</p>

## Conversion Process

<p align="justify">if you run the experimental converter.</p>

```
lucifer@hades:~/ESRGAN/models$ python3 experimentell_converter_RRDB_models.py 8x_NMKD-Superscale_150000_G.pth
```

<p align="justify">the output in the terminal window is as follows:</p>

```
***  ESRGAN CONVERTER  ***
Reference keywords to found keywords:
['model.8.weight', 'model.8.bias', 'model.10.weight', 'model.10.bias']
['model.11.weight', 'model.11.bias', 'model.13.weight', 'model.13.bias']
Input: 8x_NMKD-Superscale_150000_G.pth
Output: 8x_NMKD-Superscale_150000_G_CED.pth
Start conversion ...
... conversion completed!
```

<p align="justify">Reference keywords versus found keywords show, if there was a mismatch.</p>

## Tested Models

<p align="justify">Subsequently listed ESRGAN models next others I have tested and successful converted:</p>
 
+ 4xLSDIRplus.pth
+ 4x_foolhardy_Remacri.pth
+ 4x_FuzzyBox.pth
+ 4x-UltraSharp.pth
+ 4x_NMKD-Siax_175k.pth
+ 4x_NMKD-Siax_200k.pt
+ 4x-UniScale_Restore.pth
+ 4x-UniScaleV2_Sharp.pth
+ 4x_UniversalUpscalerV2-Sharp_101000_G.pth
+ 4x_Fatality_Comix_260000_G.pth
+ realesrgan-x4minus.pth
+ 4xPSNR.pth
+ 8xPSNR.pth
+ 8x_NMKD-Superscale_150000_G.pth (color shift after conversion?)
+ RRDB_PSNR_x4_old_arch.pth (xinntao)
+ RRDB_ESRGAN_x4_old_arch.pth (xinntao)

<p align="justify">The list is not complete, but shows
that almost every old model can already be converted. 
The algorithm seems to work well so far.</p>
  
## Compatible NEW (current) ESRGAN Models

<p align="justify">Some were analysed and found to be
new models:</p>

* RRDB_ESRGAN_x4.pth (xinntao)
* RRDB_PSNR_x4.pth (xinntao)
* ESRGAN.pth (KAIR)
* DF2K.pth

## Pickle Tensor

<p align="justify">Files in the Pickle Tensor fileformat have
in case of the ESRGAN models the extension <code>.pth</code>.
Binary as well as zip-files can be used. There is no need for
a further distinction or conversion.</p>
 
## Repository & Directory Structure

<p align="justify">The repository and directory structure of
the <i>ESRGAN RRDB CONVERTER</i> is looking as follows:</p> 

```bash
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ esrgan_rrbd_converter
        ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ original
        ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ scripts
        ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ tools
```

<p align="justify">The folder <code>original</code> contains the original 
sources from xinntao [1]. In the folder <code>tools</code> there are tools 
like the one for analysing the model structure. The folder <code>scripts
</code> contains the current converter.</p> 

## ESRGAN and AUTOMATIC1111

<p align="justify">AUTOMATIC is using the ESRGAN model
which can be downloaded from [5].</p>

## Easy Way to Test the Converter

Clone this github repository.

```
git clone https://github.com/xinntao/ESRGAN
cd ESRGAN_RRDB_CONVERTER
```

## To-Do

<p align="justify">I have to check under which conditions the converter
is working and under which conditions the converter is not working.</p>

<p align="justify">Analysis of the internal model structure to understand
the formatting of different models related to RRDB models.</p>
 
<p align="justify">I have to catch errors while executing the script.
In the experimental version I was able to realise this in a rudimentary
way.</p>
 
<p align="justify">I need an improvement of the comments in the script.
And I am also need an improvement of this documentation.</p>

## Test Environment

<p align="justify">I developed and tested the Python scripts using 
the following software development environment:</p>

* Linux Mint 21.3 (Virginia)
* Python 3.10.14
* OpenCV 4.10.0
* PIL 11.0.0
* Numpy  2.1.3
* Torch 2.4.1+cu121
  
## To-DO

<p align="justify">As soon as I have time, I will programme two slim upscalers
for ESRGAN and RealESRGAN. Then the original or converted models can be tested
directly.</p>

## Licenses

<p align="justify">The algorithms with respect to ESRGAN of xinntao are published
under theApache license. The original scripts and the improved scripts are covered
by this license. I always publish my work under the MIT license.</p> 

## Credits

<p align="justify">My thanks go to the excellent work of Xintao Wang (xinntao). 
The results that can be achieved with his approach are more than good.</p>
