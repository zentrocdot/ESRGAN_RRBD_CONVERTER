# Script model analysis.py

<p align="justify">Use <code>model analysis.py</code> for the analysis 
of ESRGAN model files. The script is able to find out 
if the given file is of type old ESRGAN, new ERSGAN or
RealESRGAN. If these three types are identified, I was 
able to convert such a model from one model to another
model so far.</p>
