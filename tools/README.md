# Script model analysis.py

<p align="justify">Use <code></code>model_analysis.py</p> to analyse
ESRGAN model files. The script is able to find out whether the given 
file is of type old ESRGAN, new ERSGAN or RealESRGAN. If these three
types are identified, I have so far been able to convert such a model
from one model to another.</p>
